HTML/Python Routes

I am researching how routes work with HTML and Python to connect the different pages of our website/application together with the home.
This will be done by getting the navigation bar to work with the routes.

I expect to learn how to connect the different forms for the features with their respective routes and how the templates are rendered
the HTML and reder_template function in Python. 

I expect to be able to connect the features together on teh app with the routes and the navigation bar, so that when the user clicks
on the tab in the navigation bar, the proper route is selected and the proper page is loaded using the HTML and render_template function.

The Jira tasks that represent the work that is dependent on this research/training are SCRUM-60: Integrate routes for each navigation bar element
and SCRUM-28: Implement Navigation Logic.
