Calorie/Workout Tracker and APIs

I am researching how to implement HTML for the front end of the Calorie/Workout Tracker feature. I am also researching APIS that might give us some help and/or functionality for this feature. This will be done by implementing the front end code in html and the backend code in python. 

I expect to be able to learn how to create the page and features in html and how to connnect it to the backend code and API functionality. 

The Jira tasks that represent the work that is dependent on this research/training are Research how to implement SCRUM-71: Workout/Calorie tracker and calculator and apis the may make it easier and SCRUM-82: Design workout/calorie tracker and calculator.
